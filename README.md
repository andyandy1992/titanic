This repository contains R code for working with the "Getting Started" kaggle competition, "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". This contains some personal tweaks having forked from https://github.com/trevorstephens/titanic (orginal README below).

To run the tutorial scripts, first ```cp load.R.sample load.R``` and configure ```load.R``` with:
- where your data is stored.
- where you wish to store output files.
- your working directory (i.e. when you have cloned this repository to).

You can then create a new workspace by running ```load.R`` prior to running the tutorial scripts.

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Getting Started With R
================================================================
Trevor Stephens - January 2014


I will be dividing this series of tutorials into five parts:

    Part 1: Booting Up R
    Part 2: The Gender-Class Model
    Part 3: Decision Trees
    Part 4: Feature Engineering
    Part 5: Random Forests

This repository contains all code used in the five part tutorial that can be found here:

If you have any questions about these lessons, Iâ€™d encourage you to post them to the Kaggle forums:
http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/forums
where many others may have already come across the issue before and can jump in to help you out.

If you notice any bugs or typos, or have any suggestions on making the tutorial easier to follow,
please send me a direct message through any of ...
